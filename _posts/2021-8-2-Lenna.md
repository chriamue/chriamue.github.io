Let me introduce you my next big project: [Lenna](https://github.com/lenna-project)

Started for learning the Rust programming language, Lenna will be much more than a Hello World App.

Still in development, it will be a [framework](https://github.com/lenna-project/lenna-core) for image processing algorithms.
Developed in Rust, bindings to wasm, c++ and python will be included.

A [command line interface](https://github.com/lenna-project/lenna-cli) will allow to convert images in a folder based on a configuration file.
![run lenna-cli](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lenna-project/lenna-cli/main/docs/images/run.gif)

The website [lenna.app](https://lenna.app) allows to test the algorithms online without installing anything.
