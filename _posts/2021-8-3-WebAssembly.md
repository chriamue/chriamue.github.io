Let me share some thoughts about WebAssembly.

One of my first programming languages I used was C++. Why did I used it? Mostly of it's speed and possibility to optimize, computation but also memory usage.

I also developed software in Java some times. Javas promise is, it runs everywhere.
Compiled C++ also runs everywhere but you have to compile and package that software for every target which is not so much fun.

Java brings its virtual machine that allows to run Java everywhere, everywhere where this virtual machine runs.

Today, I would say most computer have another 'virtual machine' already installed.
It is your browser you are reading this post with.
Your browser allows you to run WebAssembly in an isolated environment, which protects your data on your computer from programms running in the browser.
